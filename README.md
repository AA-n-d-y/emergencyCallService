The project aims to create a better version of emergency service website for the public, a more modern interface which is userfriendly and easy to follow through. It uses technologies like:
Html5
CSS3 + bootstrap
Javascript
MD5 hash for passcode storage and verification
Dom storage API to save data
This website lets the users provide info regarding the emergency in a quick manner as time would be precious. Chossing the address over a map api and providing a small comment and type of emergency.
